	<h3>research</h3>

	<p>The theoretical particles that I look for are called "long-lived" particles (or LLPs, for short). 

	These are particles that decay far out in the ATLAS detector into standard model particles, thus producing a unique signature of that standard model particle. 

	I look paritcularly at displaced tau objects in ATLAS, and my ATLAS authorship was on develop a model-indepdent displaced tau trigger (quite a tricky challenege). <p>
