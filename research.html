	<h3>about me</h3>
	<p>I'm Victoria (she/her), and I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and I work on the ATLAS experiment. My work with ATLAS focuses on using machine learning architectures to search for theoretical particless decaying to the standard model particle, tau. I hope the technology I am developing can be utilized even beyond the applications of particle physics.

	My highest awarded degrees are a Bachelor's of Arts in Physics and a Bachlors of Arts in Music: Vocal Performance and Composiiton. I went to Mount Holyoke College for my undergraduate degrees, and have wound up in Scotland now pursuing my PhD.

	I contiue to make music and have a deep appreication for new artists. 

	I am also the Chair of the Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) events committee in Edinburgh. I focus on organizing workshops, speakers, and events that build a better sense of community for our staff and post-graduate students. 

	I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community and am neurodivergent. I encourage you to reach out if you are seeking advice if you are apart of a marginalized group and are interested in getting started in STEM. <p>

	<h3>research</h3>

	<p>The theoretical particles that I look for are called "long-lived" particles (or LLPs, for short). 

	These are particles that decay far out in the ATLAS detector into standard model particles, thus producing a unique signature of that standard model particle. 

	I look paritcularly at displaced tau objects in ATLAS, and my ATLAS authorship was on develop a model-indepdent displaced tau trigger (quite a tricky challenege). <p>
