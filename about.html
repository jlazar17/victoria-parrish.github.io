	<h3>About me</h3>
	<p>I'm Victoria (she/her), and I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and I work on the ATLAS experiment. My work with ATLAS focuses on using machine learning architectures to search for theoretical particless decaying to the standard model particle, tau. I hope the technology I am developing can be utilized even beyond the applications of particle physics.
