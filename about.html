	<h3>About me</h3>
	<p>I'm Victoria (she/her), and I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and I work on the ATLAS experiment. My work with ATLAS focuses on using machine learning architectures to search for theoretical particless decaying to the standard model particle, tau. I hope the technology I am developing can be utilized even beyond the applications of particle physics. I am the egamma/tau trigger on-call expert for Run 3 data-taking to begin in the Spring.
	<p>
	I am interested in video game development. I currently work with the Unity Engine making little games to get my feet wet, but am hoping and eager to learn more about the field and world of video game design and developement. Dream projects are games like: Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Dorf Romantik, Bear and Breakfast, Lemoncake, Cozy Grove, Mail Time, etc. Really, I would work on any project that makes its players feel like they're getting a big hug and a deserved destress. 
	<p>
	My highest awarded degrees are a Bachelor's of Arts in Physics and a Bachlors of Arts in Music: Vocal Performance and Composiiton. I went to Mount Holyoke College for my undergraduate degrees, and have wound up in Scotland now pursuing my PhD.
	</p>
	I contiue to make music and have a deep appreication for new artists.

	I am also the Chair of the Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) events committee in Edinburgh. I focus on organizing workshops, speakers, and events that build a better sense of community for our staff and post-graduate students. 
	</p>
	I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community and am neurodivergent. I encourage you to reach out if you are seeking advice if you are apart of a marginalized group and are interested in getting started in STEM. <p>
