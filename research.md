## RESEARCH

Remember those theoretical particles I mentioned right up there? The ones that I look for are called "long-lived" particles (or LLPs, for short). 

These are particles that decay far out in the ATLAS detector into standard model particles, thus producing a unique signature of that standard model particle. 

I look paritcularly at displaced tau objects in ATLAS, and my ATLAS authorship was on develop a model-indepdent displaced tau trigger (quite a tricky challenege).  

ATLAS trigger:
- Run 3 displaced single and ditau trigger 

Analyses:
- Run 2 data:
	- A Run 2 search of LLPs decaying to taus (ongoing)
Awards:
- Mount Holyoke College Leadership Scholarship
- SUPA Saltire Grant

Funding:
- ERC
